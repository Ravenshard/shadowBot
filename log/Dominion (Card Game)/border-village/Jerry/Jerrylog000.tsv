Jerry	724997423105048696	Werewolves?? Surely not... I  did find some old discarded bandages a couple days ago but there was no reason to find it suspicious. I guess someone could have been covering up an infected bite though. The full moons have been particularly strong recently..	2020-06-23 14:40:55.469000	None	
Jerry	724998219133878303	We're going to have to act pretty quickly if we want to stamp the werewolves out. There could be several of them working in concert so we shouldn't even trust what we say to each other.  |newline|  |newline| Personally I hate Days like this 1. I am going to vote for governor and saccee randomly. The werewolves have way more information than us and can use it to manipulate the conversation. I'd rather go on a random target and see what happens. |newline|  |newline| First name in the random selection is my choice for governor. Second is my choice for sacrificing	2020-06-23 14:44:05.257000	None	
Jerry	724998227186942042	!random -p Caetra, Will((ow)|(iam)), Fircoal, Donkey-Dude, catoftheyear, mikaelsson, eh1414, DDL, pqr, Sharur, Ravenshard, Bazkitcase5, Rozyroz, Jerrydot, Anders, Emmi -n 2	2020-06-23 14:44:07.177000	None	
Jerry	724998490400227328	So how random was your random Caetra	2020-06-23 14:45:09.932000	None	
Jerry	724998828419317842	Adding an extra random draw is not helpful DD. If everyone votes randomly then noone gets sacced	2020-06-23 14:46:30.522000	None	
Jerry	724998993863770134	I'm starting my discussion	2020-06-23 14:47:09.967000	None	
Jerry	724999029167095828	why did DD need to create a new one rather than follow mine	2020-06-23 14:47:18.384000	None	
Jerry	724999065531580429	Then why use it for your votes?	2020-06-23 14:47:27.054000	None	
Jerry	724999084577914911	Or why not PM dombot	2020-06-23 14:47:31.595000	None	
Jerry	724999181483114596	Anyway this is the kind of discussion I wanted to avoid	2020-06-23 14:47:54.699000	None	
Jerry	724999395032039474	Voting on a random target D1 only works if there is common impetus to follow a random vote	2020-06-23 14:48:45.613000	None	
Jerry	724999439302787163	Choosing any random selection other than the first one undermines the randomness	2020-06-23 14:48:56.168000	None	
Jerry	724999729326325852	I believe in the initial random	2020-06-23 14:50:05.315000	None	
Jerry	724999775480578160	I think it's more likely to hit a ww	2020-06-23 14:50:16.319000	None	
Jerry	725000019266109481	I don't think governor is valuable D1	2020-06-23 14:51:14.442000	None	
Jerry	725000045572784189	probably not very good D2 either	2020-06-23 14:51:20.714000	None	
Jerry	725000081215979521	Dog shouldn't reveal imo	2020-06-23 14:51:29.212000	None	
Jerry	725276478576656454	Changed my votes due to Bluey's comments about provable randomness	2020-06-24 09:09:47.478000	None	
Jerry	725276565604139079	Re-voted pqr for governor because we need a governor in the same way we need a sacrifice and the deadline is coming up soon	2020-06-24 09:10:08.227000	None	
Jerry	725276675125805137	Went for unprovable randomness for sacrifice choice and got Caetra again	2020-06-24 09:10:34.339000	None	
Jerry	725276945046306838	The werewolves know who the werewolves are and the villagers don't know who the villagers are	2020-06-24 09:11:38.693000	None	
Jerry	725277003024039967	Imo we are more likely to sacc a werewolf D1 if we choose randomly	2020-06-24 09:11:52.516000	None	
Jerry	725277209295585321	I don't remember any game where the voting record on D1 was ever particularly useful	2020-06-24 09:12:41.695000	None	
Jerry	725277306490323024	There's still time for people to be convinced	2020-06-24 09:13:04.868000	None	
Jerry	725277376895778816	If a very compelling reason to not choose randomly arises then I will change	2020-06-24 09:13:21.654000	None	
Jerry	725277416536145931	But I doubt it will	2020-06-24 09:13:31.105000	None	
Jerry	725277799983874108	I think the chance of there being useful clues is lower than the increased chance of hitting a ww	2020-06-24 09:15:02.526000	None	
Jerry	725278159418818611	If you are worried about losing information, it seems like everyone else has been acting non-randomly so you still get information from them. Everyone that chooses to follow the random choice is still expressing a preference since the werewolves know whether the target is on their team	2020-06-24 09:16:28.222000	None	
Jerry	725278232726732830	No-one has made a pressure-exerting vote yet	2020-06-24 09:16:45.700000	None	
Jerry	725279891280494632	I think I agree - the main point of any votes right now is to point out potential wagon targets	2020-06-24 09:23:21.130000	None	
Jerry	725280150685483019	And atm the focus could go in any one of a number of directions	2020-06-24 09:24:22.977000	None	
Jerry	725280252015935560	Or even none of them	2020-06-24 09:24:47.136000	None	
Jerry	725280565984493578	I think the more we talk about "applying pressure" and stuff like this, it actually weakens the effect of someone being at -1, -2 etc	2020-06-24 09:26:01.992000	None	
Jerry	725280916444020737	I guess in this game with barely any PR roles, "applying pressure" just means trying to get someone to talk a lot so that other players can get reads on them	2020-06-24 09:27:25.548000	None	
Jerry	725282404582948884	Lol I like that meta reason	2020-06-24 09:33:20.348000	None	
Jerry	725282761807757362	Yeah sounds plausible if we're unexpected with the timing	2020-06-24 09:34:45.517000	None	
Jerry	725282815398117377	Just have to be careful not to give the werewolves leeway to swing votes that way	2020-06-24 09:34:58.294000	None	
Jerry	725284015170388029	Revealing peddler would be pretty bad but that's 1 in 16	2020-06-24 09:39:44.342000	None	
Jerry	725284588145868870	That would never happen mikaelsson I don't know what you are talking about xD	2020-06-24 09:42:00.950000	None	
Jerry	725284818673467444	Has anyone done the peddler maths on the best day to reveal yet?	2020-06-24 09:42:55.912000	None	
Jerry	725284906980081685	Basically what is the largest number of people you can give heirlooms to without dying, them dying or giving the werewolves an heirloom	2020-06-24 09:43:16.966000	None	
Jerry	725284986420199486	I guess calling it a "day to reveal" is inaccurate	2020-06-24 09:43:35.906000	None	
Jerry	725285050580598785	More like when to use the information aggressively	2020-06-24 09:43:51.203000	None	
Jerry	725285072311418912	Or when to stop sending out heirlooms	2020-06-24 09:43:56.384000	None	
Jerry	725285150447108186	Maybe giving the werewolves an heirloom isn't the end of the world	2020-06-24 09:44:15.013000	None	
Jerry	725285261503889429	As long as the peddler information doesn't die with the peddler	2020-06-24 09:44:41.491000	None	
Jerry	725285427581550612	peddler knows who they gave heirlooms to	2020-06-24 09:45:21.087000	None	
Jerry	725285458514542603	and therefore who knew that they were the peddler	2020-06-24 09:45:28.462000	None	
Jerry	725285778250268674	The last one to receive a ~~candle~~ heirloom might be more likely to be a ww	2020-06-24 09:46:44.693000	2020-06-24 09:47:31.269000	
Jerry	725285892549247026	If the chancellor received an heirloom previously but didn't protect the peddler, then they would be a werewolf most likely	2020-06-24 09:47:11.944000	None	
Jerry	725286772732330005	Do you not remember the conversation we had about CSM after last game?	2020-06-24 09:50:41.796000	None	
Jerry	725287055109783553	Cat's approach would be one way of doing it	2020-06-24 09:51:49.120000	None	
Jerry	725287415106895954	Other possibility is that the real peddler might be able to subtly hint in advance who they will be giving an heirloom to. They are aiming for it to look innocent during the day, but be obvious enough with hindsight if the peddler dies in the night.	2020-06-24 09:53:14.950000	None	
Jerry	725287575505600513	I think it would be difficult for the werewolves to deduce it	2020-06-24 09:53:53.192000	None	
Jerry	725287645156081664	So that if the peddler dies during the night, you know who knew they were the peddler	2020-06-24 09:54:09.798000	None	
Jerry	725287713879621693	It isn't very relevant for D1/N1 but is more important later	2020-06-24 09:54:26.183000	None	
Jerry	725288505936183298	Yeah delaying a kill does seem like a strong werewolf strat	2020-06-24 09:57:35.024000	None	
Jerry	725288750279557210	Maybe a mixed strategy is best - hypothetical list for first two days and then stop doing it?	2020-06-24 09:58:33.280000	None	
Jerry	725289179306524712	Hinting is better if it can be done well but it's really difficult and can be double-edged	2020-06-24 10:00:15.568000	None	
Jerry	725289227272585216	Since the werewolves can potentially identify the peddler from it	2020-06-24 10:00:27.004000	None	
Jerry	725289376392937483	And actually if the werewolves discover the peddler early then the hinting starts helping them in the same way	2020-06-24 10:01:02.557000	None
