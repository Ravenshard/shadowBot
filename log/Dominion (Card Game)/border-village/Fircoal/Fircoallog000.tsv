Fircoal	725021109547958403	I dont like the idea of the hound claiming nor do I like these random votes. They feel like a nice disguise so that peeps dont have to put something forward. Just blame random.	2020-06-23 16:15:02.757000	None

Fircoal	725023406101364767	Just it's easy to brush off random votes and they just dont do much espeically when out in the open like this.	2020-06-23 16:24:10.298000	None

Fircoal	725041994996646020	its important to no governor otherwise this town becomes different from all the others and we all know different is bad. After all who is the most different from a regular villagers **WEREWOLVES**	2020-06-23 17:38:02.236000	None

Fircoal	725072251124449320	Ok since we're going there anyway I think it's time to bring out some of my thoughts into the village. üòé	2020-06-23 19:38:15.859000	None	
Fircoal	725073160898085015	So here is what I was thinking. As cool as the governor sounds their powers aren't exactly that strong at this stage of the day. So while I think we all would like to be governor I don't think it's a priority for any peeps. Added to that I think there is more than just that at play. Werewolves probably are going to realize that being governor isn't actually that helpful. While having a town chancellor that could possibly block their NK is bad, it's a small chance, and probably is **the smallest chance on Night 1 than any other night.** Therefore the chancellor power is at it's weakest. Furthermore, if a werewolf is gov, in order to get a werewolf chancellor they have to pick it themselves which is going to bring a lot of suspicion onto that player if the wolfgov is ever sac'd, which means it's not a very good idea for low reward.	2020-06-23 19:41:52.766000	None	
Fircoal	725073363386761266	Why do I bring this up? Because I think the wolves will realize this and realize that the potential of looking greedy by trying to grab the gov power is not worth the tiny benefit they'd get by winning.	2020-06-23 19:42:41.043000	None	
Fircoal	725073453803110451	Thusly I feel like anyone who voted themselves to be governor is likely town	2020-06-23 19:43:02.600000	None	
Fircoal	725073797912199200	Sure but that's only if that's likely to happen, which who knows. If the wolf is a gov that makes it less likely the wolf can be a chancellor just by math.	2020-06-23 19:44:24.642000	None	
Fircoal	725073943207346206	I guess my point is, I think gov is the argument that wolves are prepared to concede. Especially this early.	2020-06-23 19:44:59.283000	None	
Fircoal	725074140423258274	Oh and as for why I'm voting mik in particular outside of not liking bandwagoning, I really don't like how he was bringing up how we should vote for the gov before we vote for sacs	2020-06-23 19:45:46.303000	None	
Fircoal	725074301807624292	Sacs are our bread and butter. That's how we get information and move the game along. 2 days is not a lot of time especially on Day 1. We need to progress, not wait for something that doesn't nearly matter as much.	2020-06-23 19:46:24.780000	None	
Fircoal	725074699335499796	no I'm not	2020-06-23 19:47:59.558000	None	
Fircoal	725074763772592279	I'm saying I don't like bandwagonning (you were the 3rd vote on pqr for gov)	2020-06-23 19:48:14.921000	None	
Fircoal	725074814074749028	Although I'm not sure how much that actually matters tbh	2020-06-23 19:48:26.914000	None	
Fircoal	725074862401519687	I'm more concerned with trying to delay sacrifice votes.	2020-06-23 19:48:38.436000	None	
Fircoal	725075024154984642	And it's not necessarily that D1 gov powers are weak (although they kinda are), it's that they're especially weak for wolves.	2020-06-23 19:49:17.001000	None	
Fircoal	725075588074701196	Just to note, I'm not against us voting on gov and finding someone, I just also want to be wolf hunting and voting at the same time.	2020-06-23 19:51:31.450000	None	
Fircoal	725075848759214091	I don't know if people dont' take them serious as much as it is that you need them to sort of ramp up so someone can slip up	2020-06-23 19:52:33.602000	None	
Fircoal	725076034784985178	I mean I am aware my arguments for example are weak, and on day 2 they'd probably be a nothingburger, but they're a starting point, and we need starting points to get to better arguments.	2020-06-23 19:53:17.954000	None

Fircoal	725076828972384326	That said I still don't think that makes wolves any more likely to ask for it because that makes them only more suspicious to ask for it. (or would to most eyes)	2020-06-23 19:56:27.303000	None
