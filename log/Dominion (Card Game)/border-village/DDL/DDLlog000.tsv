DDL	725372585621061832	that post of mine had a metaphor, don't take it too seriously	2020-06-24 15:31:41.183000	None	
DDL	725372914282659875	anyway, what did you hink Caetra was, specifically, a person who turns into a wolf-human hybrid at night?	2020-06-24 15:32:59.542000	None	
DDL	725373029370298420	what made you think he can activate all 4 of courtier's bonuses and is not named Josephine?	2020-06-24 15:33:26.981000	None

DDL	725374139656962087	well, generally your player archetype tends to be useful to town from my experience	2020-06-24 15:37:51.694000	None	
DDL	725374232065867878	I'm not sure if it's possible to engineer a sabotage of a would-be town leader in a way that benefits the wolves, though	2020-06-24 15:38:13.726000	None	
DDL	725374249887596584	then again I don't know you well	2020-06-24 15:38:17.975000	None	
DDL	725374390967075098	from experience an easier strategy would be to just kill the town leader, or get into their good side so they keep leading with you the wolf as their assitant	2020-06-24 15:38:51.611000	None	
DDL	725374935664427058	> when you say town leader do u mean governor, or just a player that leads discussion? |newline| <@!173497654561603584>  |newline|  |newline| The player that leads discussion	2020-06-24 15:41:01.477000	None	,conjugate#3677
DDL	725374964680753234	governor is just another role	2020-06-24 15:41:08.395000	None	
DDL	725375244210012312	the player who posts like mad, asks questions of everyone, analyses people's mentions of each other after wolves flip, and generally conducts the whole discussion and forces the wolves to play around them instead of setting their own narrative	2020-06-24 15:42:15.040000	None	
DDL	725375336958787594	I don't know if sharur is that kind of player, but I know a few of those	2020-06-24 15:42:37.153000	None	
DDL	725375476578779136	well this is a discord mafia tbh	2020-06-24 15:43:10.441000	None

DDL	725376346296942614	I'm generally a high poster myself, but I can't do the town leader	2020-06-24 15:46:37.798000	None	
DDL	725376357156257872	I'm too chaotic	2020-06-24 15:46:40.387000	None	
DDL	725378424461328395	I feel like I don't buy the intentional sabotage theory but I can see caetra just doubling down on the argument to increase their own post count some way. wolves need to find something to do, and a pointless argument can do the trick	2020-06-24 15:54:53.271000	None	
DDL	725378572650283048	I also feel like the opposite could happen too, with caetra attacking and sharur overreacting on purpose	2020-06-24 15:55:28.602000	None	
DDL	725378610994872410	a wolf sharur I mean	2020-06-24 15:55:37.744000	None	
DDL	725378967959240706	if you one you two is a wolf, then who picked a fight is irrelevant, what matters is that one of you chose to continue the fight because being in that fight was userful for the character you were roleplaying as	2020-06-24 15:57:02.851000	None	
DDL	725379022397243392	and if you are both village, then I suppose it was just a silly fight that happened	2020-06-24 15:57:15.830000	None	
DDL	725379194162511875	or maybe... you are both wolves and we are being played	2020-06-24 15:57:56.782000	None	
DDL	725379235166027779	I was in the middle of assuming lol	2020-06-24 15:58:06.558000	None

DDL	725379636116062270	very easy for wolves to just go "hey if I attack you now can you argue back?"	2020-06-24 15:59:42.152000	None	
DDL	725379805821796463	so what was the case on mik	2020-06-24 16:00:22.613000	None

DDL	725383801546473510	I like the reasoning. I agree wanting people not to talk about sacrifice is very counterproductive	2020-06-24 16:16:15.268000	None
