eh1414	724999319656333352	Perhaps our match tonight shall decide this, raven. if i win, you must be sacrificed, but if you defeat me, i will bow to you as our almighty governor.	2020-06-23 14:48:27.642000	None	
eh1414	724999777380466819	we can always move on a proper sacrifice once we have a governor, but for now this is fine to get some convo going	2020-06-23 14:50:16.772000	None	
eh1414	725000245951332372	ooh interesting	2020-06-23 14:52:08.488000	None	
eh1414	725000940440125510	nice, you read the thread first	2020-06-23 14:54:54.067000	None	
eh1414	725001194082271323	if i’m gov, i’ll make sure everyone’s vote counts double	2020-06-23 14:55:54.540000	None	
eh1414	725023208612298804	seems too obvious though. like if someone’s asking that, it seems more to me that they may not know the strategy etc behind the role, rather than trying to actually force a claim as a wolf	2020-06-23 16:23:23.213000	None	
eh1414	725066476003917944	people should panic earlier	2020-06-23 19:15:18.963000	None	
eh1414	725066657415954532	just to go back to something earlier, i don’t think people only voting for themselves is particularly great - it’s a mindset that if everyone adopted, it would be anti-town.	2020-06-23 19:16:02.215000	None	
eh1414	725067040200720506	cat - sure, it makes sense in isolation, but if everyone thought that was the only option for them, it’s a bad situation imo	2020-06-23 19:17:33.478000	None	
eh1414	725067586102100038	it sounds like half the votes is automatic, or just whoever has the most at the deadline	2020-06-23 19:19:43.631000	None	
eh1414	725067604770816113	i could be wrong though	2020-06-23 19:19:48.082000	None	
eh1414	725067661813219338	over half, rather	2020-06-23 19:20:01.682000	None	
eh1414	725068020015431680	it could definitely swing, that tends to happen in werewolf	2020-06-23 19:21:27.084000	None	
eh1414	725069744520298536	thanks for the math, will - that’s interesting. however, whilst i feel that the “bad” outcome can be more common, it seems less influential than the “good” outcome to me	2020-06-23 19:28:18.238000	None	
eh1414	725072180831977595	early on, it’s likely that a randomly picked chancellor is town, but a werewolf governor would quite possibly pick a town chancellor also imo, to protect their friends if they are brought down	2020-06-23 19:37:59.100000	None	
eh1414	725100068264476834	tl;dr? (i don’t actually know what this stands for)	2020-06-23 21:28:47.982000	None	
eh1414	725100336460726362	ah okay	2020-06-23 21:29:51.925000	None	
eh1414	725104808666726400	it seems to me that having a werewolf in charge can’t exactly be better, but it’s not the end of the world if so	2020-06-23 21:47:38.182000	None	
eh1414	725114774756786306	isn’t every villager on average stronger as a governor in the late game than in the early game? i don’t know that it changes the strategy that much	2020-06-23 22:27:14.283000	None	
eh1414	725116824751964272	i don’t know that this sort of debate is massively helpful to what we are trying to do here (no offence)	2020-06-23 22:35:23.040000	None	
eh1414	725116984294899843	sharur - sure, the fact that it is unhelpful can be used as evidence in that way	2020-06-23 22:36:01.078000	None	
eh1414	725122186490413097	true - that’s effectively a forced no sac	2020-06-23 22:56:41.378000	None	
eh1414	725122246884196422	so i guess we need to be super careful the day before lylo also	2020-06-23 22:56:55.777000	None	
eh1414	725122300080423023	because the previous governor carries over until a new one is elected?	2020-06-23 22:57:08.460000	None	
eh1414	725348052730118146	good afternoon everyone, sorry - i’ve been busy today. reading back now	2020-06-24 13:54:12.086000	None	
eh1414	725383581622468759	the two ways to make peddler better seem to me to be: |newline|  |newline| a) have everyone claim at the same time, to attempt to judge the claim better |newline|  |newline| b) have each possible peddler say who they are visiting/visited each day, which can be verified later	2020-06-24 16:15:22.834000	None	
eh1414	725384374849372181	true - an uncontested claim is something we should be wary of, although the werewolves may not want to all be the ones to back up their friend on a fake claim (and hence  tie themselves together)	2020-06-24 16:18:31.954000	None	
eh1414	725386414539145326	The probability of the different options seems correct to me there, but the more-likely option is less “bad” than the less-likely option is “good”, so going purely off the probabilities doesn’t seem right to me	2020-06-24 16:26:38.254000	None	
eh1414	725390268177842267	it might be worth summoning them to check their thoughts, but also to actually make sure they’ve followed everything so far	2020-06-24 16:41:57.033000	None	
eh1414	725396828790587392	My initial personal read on this coty stuff is that it is down to inexperience, although that doesn’t mean it can’t also be from a wolf. I would prefer to sacrifice less active players if possible though. Being critical of their ideas seems to be a better way to provide a punishment here than sacrificing, for me rn.	2020-06-24 17:08:01.205000	None	
eh1414	725401038114258957	i agree - it seems that on day 1 especially, the wolves can manipulate the results in a non-obvious way	2020-06-24 17:24:44.786000	None	
eh1414	725403028143865906	The main reason for me to want pqr to select chancellor themselves is to increase accountability i suppose. Although of course, people can throw in reads/advice on it that they have also.	2020-06-24 17:32:39.246000	None
