Fircoal	725073160898085015	So here is what I was thinking. As cool as the governor sounds their powers aren't exactly that strong at this stage of the day. So while I think we all would like to be governor I don't think it's a priority for any peeps. Added to that I think there is more than just that at play. Werewolves probably are going to realize that being governor isn't actually that helpful. While having a town chancellor that could possibly block their NK is bad, it's a small chance, and probably is **the smallest chance on Night 1 than any other night.** Therefore the chancellor power is at it's weakest. Furthermore, if a werewolf is gov, in order to get a werewolf chancellor they have to pick it themselves which is going to bring a lot of suspicion onto that player if the wolfgov is ever sac'd, which means it's not a very good idea for low reward.	2020-06-23 19:41:52.766000	None	
Fircoal	725073363386761266	Why do I bring this up? Because I think the wolves will realize this and realize that the potential of looking greedy by trying to grab the gov power is not worth the tiny benefit they'd get by winning.	2020-06-23 19:42:41.043000	None	
Ravenshard	725073438716461086	when I meant a yummy paragraph, I was hoping it would relate to why I should vote for mik	2020-06-23 19:42:59.003000	None

Will((ow)|(iam))	725073605586583583	> in order to get a werewolf chancellor they have to pick it themselves which is going to bring a lot of suspicion onto that player if the wolfgov is ever sac'd, which means it's not a very good idea for low reward. |newline|  |newline| Unless they pledge to choose a chancellor in a way that doesn't guarantee a specific person becomes chancellor, but it just happens to be likely to make a wolf chancellor.	2020-06-23 19:43:38.788000	None	
Fircoal	725073797912199200	Sure but that's only if that's likely to happen, which who knows. If the wolf is a gov that makes it less likely the wolf can be a chancellor just by math.	2020-06-23 19:44:24.642000	None	
Fircoal	725073943207346206	I guess my point is, I think gov is the argument that wolves are prepared to concede. Especially this early.	2020-06-23 19:44:59.283000	None

Will((ow)|(iam))	725101724762767481	It's better in general for a villager to be governor for the night immunity(meaning the wolves have fewer choices for whom to kill, so the chancellor is more likely to randomly protect the wolves' target).

Caetra	725114819694559263	please explain why "the wolves would kill you to make you shut the fuck up" is more scummy than "the wolves target active, pro-town players", when they mean EXACTLY the same thing, and the second is an agreed truth	2020-06-23 22:27:24.997000	None

It's a decent idea, but it's still asking for PRs to claim D1 when we have 1 maybe 2.  Truffles suggested the same thing in game 5.5  Now you may say Cat backed down from this suggestion and doesn't support it anymore and played it off as inexperience.

bazkitcase5	725170850302525460	so they were eliminating the 4 <werewolf693949777167253634> and probably not taking into account the government immunities	2020-06-24 02:10:03.735000	None

bazkitcase5	725171195041021982	yea, I can't see how it would be useful, but that is what I gathered	2020-06-24 02:11:25.927000	None	
Ravenshard	725171195900723222	w/o factoring in chancellor jailing someone, it's rather simple	2020-06-24 02:11:26.132000	None

Ravenshard	725171209997778975	not useful I think	2020-06-24 02:11:29.493000	None

Caetra	725171327430033408	not useful because NKs aren't random but they're also a WIFOM minefield to attempt to analyze	2020-06-24 02:11:57.491000	None

Sharur	725171443238830101	I mean I assume the idea was to say either a given villager should, or should not, be worried about getting NK	2020-06-24 02:12:25.102000	None	
bazkitcase5	725171448980701206	so it doesn't let coty off the hook by any means	2020-06-24 02:12:26.471000	None	
Sharur	725171519847661599	and, well, every villager has the same odds to be NK, regardless of what those odds are	2020-06-24 02:12:43.367000	None	
Sharur	725171569097441312	so while we could calculate that, it's pretty whatever	2020-06-24 02:12:55.109000	None

Ravenshard	725178383146811422	okay I re-read the Sharur/Caetra convo, and I understand Sharur's reaction, but I'm able to see Caetra's reasoning.  I'd say there was a communication error and the language triggered Sharur a bit and threw him off.

Sharur	725180996990795807	I mean I think the implications of referencing that meme are clear, but if Raven doesn't agree, then that's a data point in favor of me over-analyzing it	2020-06-24 02:50:22.894000	None

conjugate	725263217848483841	Answers for ravenshard: |newline|  |newline| **1) Suggested to go after lurkers 20 minutes into the game, was pre-mature to say the least.** |newline|  |newline| This wasn't very serious, although.. people were discussing things even before the game started (after we got the roles), so it isn't exactly 20 minutes. |newline|  |newline| **2) Suggested hound reveal themselves D1 to become gov.  It's a decent idea, but it's still asking for PRs to claim D1 when we have 1 maybe 2.  Truffles suggested the same thing in game 5.5  Now you may say Cat backed down from this suggestion and doesn't support it anymore and played it off as inexperience.  Truffles has a similar excuse of only playing g5 and saying the mass claim there was the only meta she knew.** |newline|  |newline| We were throwing off ideas on how to utilize the roles, the reasoning behind why i offered this is that as village we have little to no info to build on in day1, and this was at least something we can be sure about, not much more.. After hearing many solid arguments against it I backed down. |newline|  |newline| Inexperienced player VS wolf pretending stupidity argument - I have played a LOOOOT of similar deduction games (mostly resistance & secret hitler), but only played mafia a handful of times, in a very casual setting irl(we surely didn't have a defined meta, or strong deductive tendencies for the game at all), so maybe this can explain bazkit's https://discordapp.com/channels/212660788786102272/720674005807267881/725168482420785202 concerns.. but sadly I don't have a way to prove to you that i am a new player, you'll have to take my word on that (or not). To me a new player trying (perhaps not so successfully) to find reason in the chaos by throwing out there a lot of (not so good) ideas sounds like a better explanation than a WW that just decided to upset everyone by saying stupid shit and make himself a target.	2020-06-24 08:17:05.874000	None

The most I'd said is that we had a frontrunner (cat) and disagreed with about every idea put forward** |newline|  |newline| I was referring to your "we have a frontrunner" quote there, as villager i feel very uncertain about what i attribute to potential WW behavior at this point and i am not quick to write people off as one thing or the other, and i felt like your jump to conclusion there was a bit much, combined with the way this sentence was put forth as a "we the village have come to a conclusion", and not "this is my opinion", made me suspicious of your motives.	2020-06-24 08:17:13.543000	None

conjugate	725263315755860008	Maybe I'm just misunderstanding you but if anything I think your logic there is very misleading in calculating the chances for jail to save NK target and show far worse chances - there is only sense in doing the (1/15)*(1/15) multiplication if you are after saving a specific person with jail, however, since you know there will be SOME kill target, you just need to jail that target, you don't care who he is(and thus don't need to [1/15 or 1/11 or 1/12 or whatever]-guess it), so the chances of random jail working on day1 NK are(remember, this was without assuming first term gov/chance protection) 2/15 if i am not mistaken? (1/15 to hit killer with jail, 1/15 to hit his target with jail, 13/15 to hit randoms unrelated to the NK process)	2020-06-24 08:17:29.217000	None
