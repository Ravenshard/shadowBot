bazkitcase5	725022337942028315	I was hound last game and felt my biggest advantage was to stay alive as long as possible and hope to surprise catch a wolf later in the game	2020-06-23 16:19:55.629000	None	
bazkitcase5	725022489729826888	Definitely seems like that is the strength of the role	2020-06-23 16:20:31.818000	None	
bazkitcase5	725022829019398214	I agree, that certainly seems sus to me	2020-06-23 16:21:52.711000	None	
bazkitcase5	725023580408250428	That is certainly plausible eh, but still worth noting	2020-06-23 16:24:51.856000	None	
bazkitcase5	725078890346709082	Maybe bias from the last game, but I can get behind Fircoal	2020-06-23 20:04:38.773000	None	
bazkitcase5	725079455252480091	Man, now if I fall behind, I will really have 200 messages to keep up with	2020-06-23 20:06:53.457000	None	
bazkitcase5	725082374148456529	haha, good luck with that	2020-06-23 20:18:29.376000	None	
bazkitcase5	725098678737436784	just curious, Will, why is it that you want to be governor so bad?	2020-06-23 21:23:16.693000	None	
bazkitcase5	725100459668406314	is there a particular reason why you think a villager needs to be governor on day 1?	2020-06-23 21:30:21.300000	None	
bazkitcase5	725104848126869535	just to trying to understand your thoughts vs what Fircoal was discussing earlier when he said that the government roles were weaker for the <werewolf693949777167253634> on D1	2020-06-23 21:47:47.590000	None	
bazkitcase5	725104853390590033	https://discordapp.com/channels/212660788786102272/720674005807267881/725073160898085015	2020-06-23 21:47:48.845000	None	
bazkitcase5	725105221272862773	and the fact that by getting it on D1, means you can't get it again on D2	2020-06-23 21:49:16.555000	None	
bazkitcase5	725109726504812546	yes of course, we'd love to have only town governors if possible	2020-06-23 22:07:10.686000	None	
bazkitcase5	725114902708093008	so are you trying to make the case for governor Sharur in a weird way?	2020-06-23 22:27:44.789000	None	
bazkitcase5	725115195877359726	I can buy that argument even if they aren't actually making it though	2020-06-23 22:28:54.686000	None	
bazkitcase5	725115265913978940	because as town, protecting Sharur is nice and as <werewolf693949777167253634> not letting him having it late game is also nice	2020-06-23 22:29:11.384000	None	
bazkitcase5	725117817975865426	no, i think we should move on	2020-06-23 22:39:19.843000	None	
bazkitcase5	725118658740879441	I understand what you meant originally, but when I quoted it, I was just trying to get will to elaborate on why they wanted it so bad	2020-06-23 22:42:40.297000	None	
bazkitcase5	725141146510032916	Should it be concerning if anybody gets so many votes so easily or is it baseless this early?	2020-06-24 00:12:01.799000	None	
bazkitcase5	725155282899959970	the governor can not be <sacrifice655946392082186302>	2020-06-24 01:08:12.177000	None	
bazkitcase5	725155408477683752	and they immune to non rogue related NKs	2020-06-24 01:08:42.117000	None	
bazkitcase5	725155680247611463	I assume you knew that, so maybe not what you actually meant though	2020-06-24 01:09:46.912000	None	
bazkitcase5	725158797391429722	i picture "the governor" from the walking dead	2020-06-24 01:22:10.097000	None	
bazkitcase5	725165872460595321	probably as good as a read as we are going to get on D1 - I was having similar thoughts, but certainly not this detailed	2020-06-24 01:50:16.925000	None	
bazkitcase5	725166030900691054	seems to be similar to mcpep though, so hard to say if they are truly a new/inexperienced player or not	2020-06-24 01:50:54.700000	None	
bazkitcase5	725166750655578162	also, we have to consider that <werewolf693949777167253634> have day chat in this game, so does it make as much sense that a <werewolf693949777167253634> would be making so many clear mistakes without consulting the group first, unlike most other games	2020-06-24 01:53:46.303000	None	
bazkitcase5	725167008853000192	yea, definitely not assuming it, but offering it up as a point worth considering	2020-06-24 01:54:47.862000	None	
bazkitcase5	725168359506706463	they asked some pretty basic questions here: https://discordapp.com/channels/212660788786102272/720674005807267881/725069383843708978	2020-06-24 02:00:09.883000	None	
bazkitcase5	725168482420785202	but after re-reading a lot of other things they said, i don't think they are much of a "new" player	2020-06-24 02:00:39.188000	None	
bazkitcase5	725170737140334614	after re-reading it, i don't think the 1/11 or 1/12 they were talking about was meant to be anything useful - seems like they were trying to figure the odds of a random NK for whatever reason	2020-06-24 02:09:36.755000	None	
bazkitcase5	725170850302525460	so they were eliminating the 4 <werewolf693949777167253634> and probably not taking into account the government immunities	2020-06-24 02:10:03.735000	None	
bazkitcase5	725170949434900531	although, considering that <werewolf693949777167253634> could be getting the immunities, i guess that wouldn't' apply	2020-06-24 02:10:27.370000	None	
bazkitcase5	725171028560707704	nothing useful - was just trying to make sense of the conversation	2020-06-24 02:10:46.235000	None	
bazkitcase5	725171092662124545	yes that	2020-06-24 02:11:01.518000	None	
bazkitcase5	725171195041021982	yea, I can't see how it would be useful, but that is what I gathered	2020-06-24 02:11:25.927000	None	
bazkitcase5	725171448980701206	so it doesn't let coty off the hook by any means	2020-06-24 02:12:26.471000	None	
bazkitcase5	725393461594947686	to be fair, I believe anders made that same argument on D1 of G4	2020-06-24 16:54:38.403000	None
