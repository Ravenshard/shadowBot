Sharur	725109602743746641	but we still clearly want one on d1	2020-06-23 22:06:41.179000	None

Sharur	725110651638513705	it's actually optimal for town for people to fall on different points on the spectrum of "how late in the game do I want to be governor"	2020-06-23 22:10:51.255000	None

Sharur	725111026919538729	on the other hand... given that we can only actually choose one person per day, maybe it makes more sense to try to get it now, since that hardly precludes me from trying for it again later	2020-06-23 22:12:20.729000	None

Sharur	725111798554034258	that doesn't seem like a very town thing to say	2020-06-23 22:15:24.701000	None
