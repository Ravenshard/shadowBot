Anders	724999160092164106	why is everyone voting both for governor and sac? Can't we choose a governor first?	2020-06-23 14:47:49.599000	None	
Anders	724999549508386918	I suggest tabling discussion on who to sacrifice until we have a governor. That way we can let governor take lead in further discussion and use that to decide on reelection?	2020-06-23 14:49:22.443000	None	
Anders	724999600741679255	nobody has any info anyways, right, so what is the point of voting for sacrifice early?	2020-06-23 14:49:34.658000	None	
Anders	724999676893462648	it is much more valuable to get info on where the governor is steering us	2020-06-23 14:49:52.814000	None	
Anders	725081946597883995	guys, remind me again why I was complaining that the euro game had too little chat?  How did I not see this as the blessing that it was	2020-06-23 20:16:47.440000	None	
Anders	725082088004386832	should governor candidates declare running mates?	2020-06-23 20:17:21.154000	None	
Anders	725321232664494140	yes, peddler is the same role that I called candlestickmaker last game	2020-06-24 12:07:37.684000	None	
Anders	725321431986208789	the canonical name is "friendly neighbour"	2020-06-24 12:08:25.206000	None	
Anders	725322168312791116	i don't think we can infer anything based on that. This is Bluey's game, I believe in his earlier games the roles were open? At least in the first one. So all the evidence we have would be from different moderators	2020-06-24 12:11:20.760000	None	
Anders	725322196599308300	it seems like a waste of time to speculate about	2020-06-24 12:11:27.504000	None	
Anders	725322583100096544	Did he say whether it was randomized? I assumed he tried to find balance.  So we could try to figure out how many days until LYLO/MYLO if there is rogue, and how many if not, and see whether one setup makes more sense than the other.	2020-06-24 12:12:59.653000	None	
Anders	725322774884778006	I thought fruit vendor does not have to be town, so getting fruit doesn't do anything	2020-06-24 12:13:45.378000	None	
Anders	725322808250335283	in this game, getting the heirloom proves being town	2020-06-24 12:13:53.333000	None	
Anders	725322855906279434	the heirloom is not an ingame mechanic, just flavor	2020-06-24 12:14:04.695000	None	
Anders	725322893210419260	the only function is to prove innocence to recipient	2020-06-24 12:14:13.589000	None	
Anders	725322915037315155	which is what friendly neighbour does	2020-06-24 12:14:18.793000	None	
Anders	725323220676247603	yes but different from friendly neighbour	2020-06-24 12:15:31.663000	None	
Anders	725324120367300628	if my maths is correct:  If there is no rogue, we get to MYLO after 3 mis-sacks, whereas it will be LYLO if there is a rogue.  This is assuming no prevented night kills by chancellor	2020-06-24 12:19:06.166000	None	
Anders	725324620286132325	The difference between LYLO and MYLO is smaller than the difference between MYLO and LYLO-1.  So that may be weak evidence in favor of existence, since setup is such that adding the role has less impact on balance than it would with an odd number of players	2020-06-24 12:21:05.356000	None	
Anders	725324659569983548	that is weak evidence though	2020-06-24 12:21:14.722000	None	
Anders	725355380313555024	14 minutes until we can hail our new pqr overlord..   I'm fine with that, does he wish to make any final campaign promises?	2020-06-24 14:23:19.118000	None	
Anders	725357425003069492	From random blogger: How will you decide who to appoint chancellor? How will you know they are not a wolf?	2020-06-24 14:31:26.610000	None	
Anders	725358524602908804	i'll hammer for you to be governor pqr, I hope you will return the favor at some stage during this game	2020-06-24 14:35:48.775000	None	
Anders	725358632027422760	we have no rules against quid pro quo, right?	2020-06-24 14:36:14.387000	None	
Anders	725358741733507092	i think you still need 4 minutes	2020-06-24 14:36:40.543000	None	
Anders	725358763413995541	what matters is plurality at 24h	2020-06-24 14:36:45.712000	None	
Anders	725358790668713986	you can't speed it up with hammering i think	2020-06-24 14:36:52.210000	None	
Anders	725358806774579220	even if there is majority earleir	2020-06-24 14:36:56.050000	None	
Anders	725358825363865600	if I understood rules correctly?	2020-06-24 14:37:00.482000	None	
Anders	725358861183221770	oh ok	2020-06-24 14:37:09.022000	None	
Anders	725358932054507542	day is still 48 hours? Or 24 hours from hammer?	2020-06-24 14:37:25.919000	None	
Anders	725358947304996946	I hope I didn't steal 4 minutes ðŸ˜¦	2020-06-24 14:37:29.555000	None	
Anders	725359175894433882	pqr, I gave you a mandate!	2020-06-24 14:38:24.055000	None	
Anders	725359200716455966	that's got to count for something	2020-06-24 14:38:29.973000	None	
Anders	725359224321867826	you have so much political capital in this town	2020-06-24 14:38:35.601000	None	
Anders	725359934090379294	i'm going to ask myself not what pqr can do for me, but what I can do for the village	2020-06-24 14:41:24.823000	None	
Anders	725390879925338203	hi pqr	2020-06-24 16:44:22.885000	None	
Anders	725390903572693062	what would you like to hear my thoughts on?	2020-06-24 16:44:28.523000	None	
Anders	725392288083083365	I don't think it is crazy to refuse to answer about who you find suspicious on day 1. Everything is essentially noise. I also don't think a wolf would actively push for a pr reveal, it is too risky (unless they genuinely thought it was a good strategy for town and are trying to get credit for it).	2020-06-24 16:49:58.616000	None	
Anders	725392429028475002	In general, I prefer sacking inactive players on day 1. I will try my best to be more active. Right now I have a blitz game against singletee in 10 mins though	2020-06-24 16:50:32.220000	None	
Anders	725393515772641320	I am inexperienced and may be wrong, but I think on day 1, wolves are unlikely to do anything highly suspicious. There is no need, it would be bad play. So we have mostly noise, and if people are forced into reading tealeaves and saying who they find suspicious, we get a vicious circle where villagers on day 2 find each other suspicious because of their incorrect suscpicions that they were forced to make public on day 1	2020-06-24 16:54:51.320000	None	
Anders	725395768495570965	can we discuss the timetable for this sac? Will enough people be awake at deadline? If not, do americans sacrifice without europeans in their evening?  Or do we try to sacrifice today 11pm utc?	2020-06-24 17:03:48.411000	None	
Anders	725396039305265172	what? Did I support an idea? I said I didn't think raising it was enough to make me suspect them to any significant degree?	2020-06-24 17:04:52.977000	None	
Anders	725396241290231898	it is support of the player who made a bad suggestion, not support of the suggestion	2020-06-24 17:05:41.134000	None	
Anders	725396251532853360	those are different things	2020-06-24 17:05:43.576000	None	
Anders	725396377672351755	i would much rather sacrifice the player with lowest activity than a player who makes a bad suggestion	2020-06-24 17:06:13.650000	None	
Anders	725396437986312202	what idea are we talking about again?  did i miss someting?	2020-06-24 17:06:28.030000	None	
Anders	725396463441412126	i thought it was in response to idea of hound claiming	2020-06-24 17:06:34.099000	None	
Anders	725396487105675305	which I certainly do not support and have not supported	2020-06-24 17:06:39.741000	None	
Anders	725396519368392774	i have not read the full backlog, sorry	2020-06-24 17:06:47.433000	None	
Anders	725396693222162513	the timetable is an important point, but i agree it was bad to interupt discussion. It was simply because the idea struck me and it seemed important and I didn't want to forget	2020-06-24 17:07:28.883000	None	
Anders	725396793692520491	by writing it in chat , I was hoping that it would be in the back of the mind of everyone, so that we can discuss it when things get less heated	2020-06-24 17:07:52.837000	None	
Anders	725396819802062889	because it needs to be discussed in the next four hours	2020-06-24 17:07:59.062000	None	
Anders	725396984864964740	pqr, wtf are you saying? You are straight up lying. I never supported any idea itself. I demand correction, or I vote to impeach	2020-06-24 17:08:38.416000	None	
Anders	725397016850464788	or at least I will challenge you tomorrow	2020-06-24 17:08:46.042000	None	
Anders	725397946966999070	show me a single fucking person who agrees that that text support hound claiming	2020-06-24 17:12:27.799000	None	
Anders	725397963240898660	and i will sack myself	2020-06-24 17:12:31.679000	None	
Anders	725398152068464760	supporting the idea of not saying who is suspicious you mean?	2020-06-24 17:13:16.699000	None	
Anders	725399219682148423	ok, so I have sympathy for the idea that the threshold for suspicion that leads to stating it in chat, should be at a level that some people won't reach on day 1	2020-06-24 17:17:31.238000	None	
Anders	725399282299043923	and I don't think that should necessarily be held against them	2020-06-24 17:17:46.167000	None	
Anders	725400041346302334	i guess I am out of the running, unless you want a village unity ticket	2020-06-24 17:20:47.138000	None
