Ravenshard	725162134522298418	My case for a scum read on catoftheyear: |newline| > I say we sacrifice some1 that didnt talk up to this point |newline| 1) Suggested to go after lurkers 20 minutes into the game, was pre-mature to say the least. |newline| > So how about the doggovernor plan? |newline| 2) Suggested hound reveal themselves D1 to become gov.  It's a decent idea, but it's still asking for PRs to claim D1 when we have 1 maybe 2.  Truffles suggested the same thing in game 5.5  Now you may say Cat backed down from this suggestion and doesn't support it anymore and played it off as inexperience.  Truffles has a similar excuse of only playing g5 and saying the mass claim there was the only meta she knew. |newline| > im gonna vote sacrifice for raven, he seems to be very quick to blame others |newline| 3) Voted for me cause I'm "quick to blame others" - this is an opinion and it's fine.  I just don't know where I was "blaming" others anywhere.  The most I'd said is that we had a frontrunner (cat) and disagreed with about every idea put forward |newline| > so 1/11 or 1/12 for the random night kill |newline| 4)  Bad logic, to me it appears Cat is trying to mislead town.  Numbers are hard so I'm not blaming them, but nonetheless, bad logic |newline| > good question, i dont have any particularly strong hunch |newline| > also im not entirely sure if i just wanna throw all my guesses out here just yet, if they are too good maybe i will be swiftly rid of in night phase |newline| > i tend to assume people who aggressively blame me are WWs, but they might just be paranoid villagers:) |newline| 5) Refusing to answer who they think are sus?  It seems like such anti-town activity it's crazy to me.  I was actually blown away when this is the answer I got to the question "who do you think could possibly be a werewolf right now?"	2020-06-24 01:35:25.731000	None
