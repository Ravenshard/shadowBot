Will((ow)|(iam))	725068991436947496	Here's the math: |newline|  |newline| Random governor,  |newline| 1/4 chance governor is WW. Given governor is WW, 0% chance chancellor prevents kill, and we might have a roleblocker on the WW team. |newline| 3/4 chance governor is village-aligned. Given governor is village-aligned, 4/15 chance chancellor is WW so we have a roleblocker on the WW team. Given chancellor is village-aligned, 3/15 chance to prevent a kill(1 if they select active WW, 1 if they select rogue, 1 if they select WW target). |newline|  |newline| Chance given random gov we have bad chancellor: 1/4+(3/4 * 4/15)=45%. |newline| Chance given random gov we prevent a WW kill: 3/4 * 3/15=15%. |newline|  |newline| Seems like having a bad chancellor is one third as influential as preventing a WW kill, so it seems like a wash.	2020-06-23 19:25:18.689000	None

Will((ow)|(iam))	725101724762767481	It's better in general for a villager to be governor for the night immunity(meaning the wolves have fewer choices for whom to kill, so the chancellor is more likely to randomly protect the wolves' target).
