mikaelsson	725028777188524153	Voting for a sacrifice before voting for a governor seems a bit WWish. Not having a gov means we donâ€™t have a chancellor and not have the opportunity to stop the night kill...	2020-06-23 16:45:30.865000	None	
mikaelsson	725029117996564513	So even if most of you are joking around, we should definitely vote for a gov first.	2020-06-23 16:46:52.120000	None	
mikaelsson	725030353131143280	Does the gov get elected if he has the majority of the votes before deadline or is it at the actual deadline the votes gets counted to see who has won it?	2020-06-23 16:51:46.599000	None

mikaelsson	725066313717907466	have we ever considered to shorten d1 to only 24 hours? we mostly wait for the panic before deadline anyway	2020-06-23 19:14:40.271000	None

mikaelsson	725075292032466985	but anyway, my main reason for wanting to vote on a gov is not that the chancellor will have a chance to block the NK	2020-06-23 19:50:20.868000	None	
mikaelsson	725075444650475570	my main reason was that i want someone to lead the discussion and to pin messages/polls to help summarizing whats happening	2020-06-23 19:50:57.255000	None	
mikaelsson	725075626620354600	im not trying to delay any sacrifice votes, but i know from experience no one takes them serious untill deadline gets closer, hence why i want shorter d1	2020-06-23 19:51:40.640000	None	
mikaelsson	725075838944542770	i think if we get a gov, we might be able to syncronize better and maybe, just maybe, be able to put pressure on people before deadline	2020-06-23 19:52:31.262000	None	
mikaelsson	725075939846914240	yes, i can agree to that	2020-06-23 19:52:55.319000	None

mikaelsson	725076962690859050	yeah i can sort of admit its gonna be hard for anyone to lead this town at this point, but Im hoping the gov takes the responsibility to pin stuff thats worth noting	2020-06-23 19:56:59.184000	None	
mikaelsson	725077216173621368	i mean, when I wake up tomo and sharur is back I dont want to read 1000+ messages	2020-06-23 19:57:59.619000	None

mikaelsson	725086861542031360	If we gonna have 1000+ messages i do think it would be good to have some sort of system for europeans to catch up what has happened at night	2020-06-23 20:36:19.254000	None	
mikaelsson	725087004416540772	and pqr does actually seems to be able to better do that than say for example caetra.....	2020-06-23 20:36:53.318000	None	
mikaelsson	725087316925743165	since he is the only one who can pin messages	2020-06-23 20:38:07.826000	None	
mikaelsson	725087386291273758	not saying he has to be the one writing them	2020-06-23 20:38:24.364000	None	
mikaelsson	725089496021991464	lets just vote for a gov then so we can start focus on the sac?	2020-06-23 20:46:47.363000	None	
mikaelsson	725233746525028414	Ok, so we are getting closer to electing our first governor. Is there anything else worth noting from last night?	2020-06-24 06:19:59.363000	None	
mikaelsson	725234612166590548	... now is the time I want a pinned message that links to messages and polls that might be of interest.	2020-06-24 06:23:25.748000	None	
mikaelsson	725271845997248563	> - mikael, for asking peddler to reveal themselves to him after saying peddler should be careful not to reveal themselves (or maybe he is just making a 5d chess move as a peddler but that seems a bit of a stretch) |newline| >  |newline| <@!173497654561603584>	2020-06-24 08:51:22.985000	None	,conjugate#3677
mikaelsson	725272349787553794	fyi I was "peddler" last game and I stretched very far to try and look I wasnt. (However, that partly made us loose the game since the WWs already knew I was the "peddler" so I was only hiding the info from my fellow villagers..)	2020-06-24 08:53:23.098000	None	
mikaelsson	725277628579184651	by itself it might be hard to get any useful info on votingpatterns d1, but when we have a few confirmed villagers and WWs there might be some clues when we look back	2020-06-24 09:14:21.660000	None	
mikaelsson	725277931022319678	but, for it to matter the votes has to be done with the purpose of actually put pressure and threat of sacing the player	2020-06-24 09:15:33.768000	None	
mikaelsson	725278528840663102	hmm.. I think we were argumenting about two different things at the same time	2020-06-24 09:17:56.299000	None	
mikaelsson	725278874325483520	Im not against that the first vote is random ( I mean, since its d1 all votes is almost random if noone slips up badly).	2020-06-24 09:19:18.669000	None	
mikaelsson	725279433883123732	I could be wrong here, but I dont think it matters if the vote is random or not if the person making it dont expect the player he voted for will get any pressure on him and eventually be at risk of a sac	2020-06-24 09:21:32.078000	None	
mikaelsson	725279800834392114	The game I played as a WW I actually "started" a vote-train against a fellow WW just because I knew no one would hammer the first person getting pressured	2020-06-24 09:22:59.566000	None	
mikaelsson	725280430734966855	yes, and since it seems to be the meta to wait until deadline for a sac, the wagons doesnt mean that much the first 44 hours of d1 imo	2020-06-24 09:25:29.746000	None	
mikaelsson	725280754837487737	yes I agree. Thats why I keep talking about sacing before deadline.	2020-06-24 09:26:47.018000	None	
mikaelsson	725280933808177250	If we sacrifice someone unexpectedly it might not be the best for the town right now	2020-06-24 09:27:29.688000	None	
mikaelsson	725281815417323580	but in the long term it will benefit the the wagons i think	2020-06-24 09:30:59.880000	None	
mikaelsson	725282132548911188	by unexpectedlly I mean that we actually sacrifice someone that we have a wagon on before deadline	2020-06-24 09:32:15.490000	None	
mikaelsson	725282326669426748	...and for meta reasons I would say that person should be someone who fails to defend themselves while being at L-1	2020-06-24 09:33:01.772000	None	
mikaelsson	725283267787489330	I understand the critics about putting to much pressure on people could get our PRs to reveal themselves too early, but in this game when we dont have many PRs thats not much of a problem	2020-06-24 09:36:46.152000	None	
mikaelsson	725283606905356378	to be fair, I think Ive tried to have this discussion every game so some people are prob tired of listening to me going on about it	2020-06-24 09:38:07.004000	None	
mikaelsson	725284035592585256	If I talk about wagons and putting pressure on people early no one takes it seriously.   And if I talk about trying to sacrifice someone early people dont want to vote cuz they dont want to sacrifice prematurely	2020-06-24 09:39:49.211000	None	
mikaelsson	725284477940662318	or the peddler sends a heirloom to a WW and plays as he is hidden and the WWs just play along to use it in their favor..............................	2020-06-24 09:41:34.675000	None

mikaelsson	725285250598699042	yeah i wonder about the discussion whether sening heirloom every night is one we should have	2020-06-24 09:44:38.891000	None	
mikaelsson	725285307058094111	or if thats something for the peddler to figure out himself	2020-06-24 09:44:52.352000	None	
mikaelsson	725285377207959562	peddler has no info	2020-06-24 09:45:09.077000	None	
mikaelsson	725285657450381343	what would that info gain?  that one of them has to be a WW?	2020-06-24 09:46:15.892000	None	
mikaelsson	725286340039802932	hmm, I fail to see a situation where we actually can use such info	2020-06-24 09:48:58.634000	None	
mikaelsson	725286488484610092	cuz if the peddler says who has giving heirloom to, then everyone knows who he is	2020-06-24 09:49:34.026000	None	
mikaelsson	725286688674545695	and when he is dead, no one else can say who he has given it to	2020-06-24 09:50:21.755000	None

mikaelsson	725288489016360990	It would be good if the peddler survived until late game and then revealed themselves, but giving out a lot of heirlooms early wont help that?	2020-06-24 09:57:30.990000	None	
mikaelsson	725289043742687262	im just waiting for the  mod to say there is no peddler in this game so we can stop having this conversation ðŸ™‚	2020-06-24 09:59:43.247000	None

mikaelsson	725293670433292379	the % of the potential Hound and Peddler to die tonight is low, so at least wait 1 or 2 days before reveal imo. When they reveal they might be able to get a 1 night protection from government duties before needing help from chancellor	2020-06-24 10:18:06.336000	None	
mikaelsson	725293799248756748	how many days ~~to ~~ do we expect this game to last for?	2020-06-24 10:18:37.048000	2020-06-24 10:18:55.933000

mikaelsson	725305949824221285	hopefully PRs survive 2-3 days with little pressure on them before they will be useful	2020-06-24 11:06:53.971000	None	
mikaelsson	725306288233512991	I wonder if its best for the peddler to not give any heirlooms until they claim?	2020-06-24 11:08:14.654000	None	
mikaelsson	725306698817863701	a counterclaim is just positive since we then know at least one of them is a WW	2020-06-24 11:09:52.545000	None	
mikaelsson	725306876819931208	I suppose a WW could falseclaim and be confirmed by another WW, but that seems to be a risky play unless we are close to lylo	2020-06-24 11:10:34.984000	None
