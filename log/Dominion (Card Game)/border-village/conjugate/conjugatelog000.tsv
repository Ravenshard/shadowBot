conjugate	725263217848483841	Answers for ravenshard: |newline|  |newline| **1) Suggested to go after lurkers 20 minutes into the game, was pre-mature to say the least.** |newline|  |newline| This wasn't very serious, although.. people were discussing things even before the game started (after we got the roles), so it isn't exactly 20 minutes. |newline|  |newline| **2) Suggested hound reveal themselves D1 to become gov.  It's a decent idea, but it's still asking for PRs to claim D1 when we have 1 maybe 2.  Truffles suggested the same thing in game 5.5  Now you may say Cat backed down from this suggestion and doesn't support it anymore and played it off as inexperience.  Truffles has a similar excuse of only playing g5 and saying the mass claim there was the only meta she knew.** |newline|  |newline| We were throwing off ideas on how to utilize the roles, the reasoning behind why i offered this is that as village we have little to no info to build on in day1, and this was at least something we can be sure about, not much more.. After hearing many solid arguments against it I backed down. |newline|  |newline| Inexperienced player VS wolf pretending stupidity argument - I have played a LOOOOT of similar deduction games (mostly resistance & secret hitler), but only played mafia a handful of times, in a very casual setting irl(we surely didn't have a defined meta, or strong deductive tendencies for the game at all), so maybe this can explain bazkit's https://discordapp.com/channels/212660788786102272/720674005807267881/725168482420785202 concerns.. but sadly I don't have a way to prove to you that i am a new player, you'll have to take my word on that (or not). To me a new player trying (perhaps not so successfully) to find reason in the chaos by throwing out there a lot of (not so good) ideas sounds like a better explanation than a WW that just decided to upset everyone by saying stupid shit and make himself a target.	2020-06-24 08:17:05.874000	None

The most I'd said is that we had a frontrunner (cat) and disagreed with about every idea put forward** |newline|  |newline| I was referring to your "we have a frontrunner" quote there, as villager i feel very uncertain about what i attribute to potential WW behavior at this point and i am not quick to write people off as one thing or the other, and i felt like your jump to conclusion there was a bit much, combined with the way this sentence was put forth as a "we the village have come to a conclusion", and not "this is my opinion", made me suspicious of your motives.	2020-06-24 08:17:13.543000	None	
conjugate	725263285494087711	**4)  Bad logic, to me it appears Cat is trying to mislead town.  Numbers are hard so I'm not blaming them, but nonetheless, bad logic** |newline|  |newline| So what we were talking about there is odds for randomally chosen jail to be effective (no longer a relevant discussion because since then proven randomness was banned), I can try to shed some light on that, but I should also mention that at this point I was not quite aware that gov and chancellor are immune to NK on first term, so all numbers are off and it was all nonsense anyway: |newline|  |newline| in here https://discordapp.com/channels/212660788786102272/720674005807267881/725034285693796433 |newline| raven said 1/15 for random night kill, i assumed that meant 1/15 for each villager to die during the night, and then responded that the wolves obviously wont kill their own, so i suggested 1/12 or 1/11 as the chances for each villager to die during the night on random NK choice (depending if we have 12 or 11 villagers at that point, based on our sacrifice results today). if we sacd a wolf, we would have 12 villagers, and thus a 1/12 chance for each of the villagers to die that night, but if we sacced a villager we would have 1/11 for each of the villagers to die that night. this is all i meant with these numbers. The fact he even suggests 1/15 for random NK makes me suspect him as WW a bit more (misstep of a wolf too deep in the "we are all together" cover mentality to remember there aren't 15 potential targets but 15-[WW couunt]?)	2020-06-24 08:17:22.002000	None	
conjugate	725263315755860008	Maybe I'm just misunderstanding you but if anything I think your logic there is very misleading in calculating the chances for jail to save NK target and show far worse chances - there is only sense in doing the (1/15)*(1/15) multiplication if you are after saving a specific person with jail, however, since you know there will be SOME kill target, you just need to jail that target, you don't care who he is(and thus don't need to [1/15 or 1/11 or 1/12 or whatever]-guess it), so the chances of random jail working on day1 NK are(remember, this was without assuming first term gov/chance protection) 2/15 if i am not mistaken? (1/15 to hit killer with jail, 1/15 to hit his target with jail, 13/15 to hit randoms unrelated to the NK process)	2020-06-24 08:17:29.217000	None
